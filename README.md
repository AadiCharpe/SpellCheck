A simple Java project that checks spelling and tells you words that are misspelled, as well as the line number that they are on. Just type in the top text box, and click "Check Spelling". Your mistakes will appear in the bottom text box, if there are any. Note: This program will not know the latest words in the English language, but almost all words will work with this program. It will not tell you what the correct word is, only the words you misspelled. You can modify the english.txt file if you really want to, for the latest words.
